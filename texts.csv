1,"134 | Social Education | May/June 2025 Letter from a U.S. Government Teacher Monte F. Bourjaily, IV As a teacher of American government and America’s history, I find myself in the strange posi- tion of asking myself if our structure of government is changing unrecognizably as I try to teach my students about our political system. Those leading our country appear to be asserting powers to chal- lenge norms that have defined our Constitutional Republic since before its actual founding. Clearly many Americans believe our political system is not serving them. Too many distrust government. Some see it as broken. Are the tsunami of actions at the start of the Trump administration’s second term (over 100 executive orders in the first month) necessary or appropriate responses? What role do we as citizens play in evaluating and responding to the actions of our elected officials and what can each of us do? My students and I are examining these questions together. The second Trump administration is asserting extraordinary executive power under something called the unitary executive theory. Hamilton, in Federalist 70, was the first to refer to the unitary executive and to ascribe to it the important quali- ties of energy that gave its executing power force, but his key reason for a single executive was accountability. As he said, “multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection … to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure … ought really to fall.” As consequences of executive action mount, what role should accountability play in a study of our political system? What I see is a government that seeks to over- turn the constitutionally prescribed norms of our Republic, because it is impatient to change what was intentionally constructed through separation of powers and checks and balances to slow the government process. President Trump’s flood of executive orders appear to usurp Congress’s power to make law, including the “Power of the Purse,” and allow him to create a “department” (DOGE), appoint an unofficial “secretary” not subject to Senate confirmation (Elon Musk), direct that “department” to freeze government spending appropriated by law passed by Congress, and dis- mantle USAID and other agencies without notice to Congress. Ironically, this sounds like the very tyrannical exercise of power that the distribution of power among competing power centers was designed to prevent. Interest was to compete against interest, with legislators as jealous of their power as the president is of his. Instead, the executive branch is asserting powers over appropriations and the very creation and destruction of government that are constitutionally defined and have been understood to be reserved to the legislative branch. Rather than assert their power, some in Congress have expressed their hopes that the courts will resolve these questions. My students’ inquiries lead me to ask ‘how do I teach this?’ Do I wait for the U.S. Supreme Court to certify that this new interpre- tation conforms to the Constitution, or reject it as executive overreach, or give the executive branch the win by saying it cannot decide because it is a political question? What happens if the Court rules against the president and he rejects or ignores the decision? The foundations of our Republic were revealed long before the American Revolution with ideas like the legislature’s power of the purse and that truth was a defense against seditious libel. Popular sovereignty, or self-rule, was the underlying big idea. As a republic, we have always elected and worked through our representatives. In Federalist 51, Madison observed that Congress, with its legislative power, was the most powerful of the three branches and therefore needed to be further Social Education 89 (3) ©2025 National Council for the Social Studies Point of View"

Americans complain that both parties are failing to govern and to “vote the bums out” each election cycle because they don’t feel relief. Instead, we remain narrowly divided by party and deeply dis- trustful of politicians, parties, and institutions. What we call polarization might instead be seen as the realization of Madison’s warning, in Federalist 10, about the tyranny of faction that became George Washington’s Farewell Address admonition against party in government, namely, that “The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpe- trated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism…. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions.” Today, party, money, and media atten- tion combine to redirect elected officials away from governance and toward actions and acquiescence in an appeal to those constituencies that threaten their prospects for reelection. Polarization, distrust, and cynicism have allowed a dangerous idea to enter our discourse, one that rejects the tension inherent in our political system, a respect for both freedom and equality protected under the rule of law that facilitates both majority rule and the protection of minority rights. The new, dangerous idea suggests that only power is impor- tant and that the ends justify the means, displacing the rule of law. On February 15, President Trump tweeted, “He who saves his country does not vio- late the law.” The day before, at the Munich Security Conference, Vice President J.D. Vance attacked not only our European allies and the NATO Alliance, but also America’s values by asserting that all speech is equal. As my students study, neither the rule of law generally nor our First Amendment protect libel, slander, incitement to violence, and other danger- ous and valueless speech. The marketplace of ideas is easily corrupted when it is flooded by the disinformation of those who knowingly spread falsehood in the hope of confusing the listener. Do we Americans no longer find strength in the virtue of American values distilled as the American Creed (“liberty, equality, individualism, democracy and the rule of law under a constitution”) by Samuel Huntington in his book American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony (1981)? Ronald Reagan referred hopefully to the United States as a “City on a Hill,” drawing on the positive interpretation of John Winthrop’s warning to the Puritans. The other side of that coin was Winthrop’s admonition that the world was watching the Puritans. They could either be a “Model of Christian Charity” or a warning to the world of the tragedy that failure would bring. This leads me to an earlier, darker premonition from Reagan when he became California’s governor: Freedom is a fragile thing and it’s never more than a generation away from extinc- tion. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and defended con- stantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people. And those in world history who have known freedom and then lost it have never known it again. Teaching about our political system, our place in it and what we can do has never been more impor- tant. This is not just a classroom activity. Congress needs our help. So do our state and local elected officials and the communities in which we live. Democracy, our democracy, is organic and requires each of us to think about what we want and try our best to do something. President Trump, through the speed and volume of his executive orders, demonstrates the power of action. If we want Congress to act, our senators and representatives need to hear from us. More importantly, they need to see us acting. Monte F.
