# A Novel RAG-Based Chatbot Solution to Improve Textbook Material Understanding

Abstract: Mainstream large language models answer general questions from a user, but they aren't well-suited to semantically pick out relevant text from textbooks and lengthy PDF files, nor do they make use of this information retrieval towards proven active recall methods. We introduce a novel method that combines information retrieval through semantic search with active recall methods to create a chatbot that improves understanding of textbook content and the quality of study sessions. Our implementation, which leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and a Rephrase-and-Respond (RaR) strategy, was evaluated across six AP-level subjects, achieving an average performance score of 0.906 out of 1.0. The chatbot demonstrated strong accuracy, reasoning, and memory retention, with particularly high performance in content areas such as History and Chemistry. These results highlight the potential of our system to provide credible academic assistance across a range of subjects and formats.
